# Introduction
<br/>

<p>This software is meant to be just a project for the post graduation java architec course by Infnet. <br/>
The software consists in a ranking of players that can be computed per city, or state or region.</p>

<p>The main idea is that the players can put their actions inside a match, and each action must have their points computed accordingly to the difficulty of the action. <br/><br/>
The players with more points will be classified as the best player of the match / city / region / month, creating a ranking of the best players of the region.</p>
